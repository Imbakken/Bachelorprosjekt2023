## :pushpin: About the project
In a group of two students, we have worked over two semesters in collaboration with Gjestvang Eiendom to develop an application for students who live in student accommodation. The aim has been to create an application that makes the experience of living in a student accommodation more predictable, social and less lonely. Throughout the process, we have used insight methodology such as; interviews, surveys, personas and design methods such as; wireframes, lo-fi and hi-fi prototypes. The finished product is an application that makes it possible to create events inside your own student accommodation, see events nearby and the necessary information from the landlord.
